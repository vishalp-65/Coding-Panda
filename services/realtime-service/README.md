npm run test:watch
```

## Deployment

### Docker
```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY dist ./dist
EXPOSE 3006
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Kubernetes
```yaml

  name: realtime-service
spec:
  replicas: 3

    matchLabels:
      app: realtime-service

        env:
        - name: REDIS_URL
          value: "redis://redis-service:6379"
        - name: JWT_SECRET
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: jwt-secret
              key: secret
```

## Monitoring

### Health Checks
The service provides a health check endpoint at `/health` that returns:
- Service status
- Timestamp
- Service name

### Metrics
Key metrics to monitor:
- Active WebSocket connections
- Message throughput
- Room occupancy
- Redis connection status
- Memory usage
- Response times

### Logging
Structured logging with different levels:
- `error` - Error conditions
- `warn` - Warning conditions
- `info` - Informational messages
- `debug` - Debug information

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- JWT tokens are validated on every WebSocket connection
- Tokens must be provided in either `auth.token` or `Authorization` header
- Expired or invalid tokens result in connection rejection

### Authorization
- Role-based access control for sensitive operations
- Room-specific access validation
- User permissions checked before allowing actions

### Data Protection
- All communications are encrypted in transit
- Sensitive data is not logged
- User data is properly sanitized

### Rate Limiting
- Message rate limiting to prevent spam
- Connection rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Resource usage monitoring and limits
