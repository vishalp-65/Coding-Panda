    company_type=CompanyType.BIG_TECH,
    difficulty_level=DifficultyLevel.MEDIUM,
    max_questions=5,
    time_limit=60
)

session = await interview_service.create_interview_session(**request.dict())
```

### Starting an Interview

```python
# Start the interview session
started_session = await interview_service.start_interview_session(
    session_id=session.id,
    user_preferences={"allow_hints": True}
)
```

### Submitting a Response

```python
# Submit code solution
response = SubmitResponseRequest(
    session_id=session.id,
    question_id="q1",
    response_text="I'll solve this using a hash map approach",
    code_solution="""
def two_sum(nums, target):
    num_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
    return []
    """,
    language=ProgrammingLanguage.PYTHON,
    confidence_level=4
)

updated_session, next_question = await interview_service.submit_response(**response.dict())
```

### Getting Feedback

```python
# Get comprehensive feedback after completion
feedback = await interview_service.evaluate_interview_performance(session.id)

print(f"Overall Score: {feedback.overall_score}/10")
print(f"Technical Score: {feedback.technical_score}/10")
print(f"Communication Score: {feedback.communication_score}/10")
print(f"Key Strengths: {feedback.key_strengths}")
print(f"Areas for Improvement: {feedback.areas_for_improvement}")
```

```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# AI Service Configuration

## Deployment

The interview simulation service is designed to be deployed as part of the AI Analysis Service microservice. It requires:

- **Redis**: For session state management and caching
- **PostgreSQL**: For persistent data storage (optional)
- **AI Service**: OpenAI or Anthropic API access
- **Authentication Service**: JWT token validation

1. **Video Interview Support**: Integration with video calling platforms
2. **Collaborative Coding**: Real-time collaborative code editing
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning-based performance prediction
4. **Custom Question Banks**: User-defined question sets and evaluation criteria
5. **Multi-language Support**: Support for additional programming languages
6. **Mobile App Integration**: Native mobile app support for interviews

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **AI Service Unavailable**: System falls back to curated question bank
2. **Session Timeout**: Configurable session timeouts with auto-save
3. **Authentication Errors**: JWT token validation and refresh handling
4. **Performance Issues**: Redis caching and connection pooling optimization

### Monitoring

- **Health Checks**: `/api/v1/interview/health` endpoint
- **Metrics**: Prometheus-compatible metrics for monitoring
- **Logging**: Structured logging with correlation IDs
- **Alerting**: Automated alerts for service degradation
